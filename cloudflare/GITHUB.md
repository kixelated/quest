# GitHub App integration

The operator registers one public Quest App from the reviewed
[manifest](github-app-manifest.json). Project users install that existing App;
they do not create their own bots. The same App's OAuth client signs users in,
while its installation identity authors service comments and pull requests. App secrets
and installation tokens stay inside the Worker; agents receive neither.

## Permissions and events

| Repository permission | Why the installation grants it                                             | Per-operation token                                            |
| --------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------- |

| Checks: read          | Observe checks on a commit                                                 | Check reads only                                               |

The manifest subscribes to push, issues, issue comments, pull requests, reviews,
review threads, inline review comments, checks and statuses. Existing App registrations
must enable `pull_request_review_thread` and `pull_request_review_comment` in their
webhook subscriptions so resolving discussions and replying inline wake merge jobs. GitHub also sends installation lifecycle and repository
selection events automatically. The App also requests the **Email addresses: read**
user permission, which Better Auth needs to sign in users whose email is private.
It grants no repository authority: the user token is used only for the sign-in
profile and email reads, and never for repository writes. No organization,
administration, workflow, or checks-write permissions are requested. These installation grants
are necessarily broader than individual operations: minted tokens always name
one repository ID and the particular permissions required. Tokens are never
cached and are revoked after use; failed cleanup is logged without secrets and
does not retry a successful write. GitHub also expires tokens after an hour.

## Trusted boundary

`src/github/service.ts` provides specific server-only operations for quest
reads, issue/PR reads, check/status reads, comments, job publication (see
[Publication](#publication)), and an explicitly authorized merge with an
expected head SHA.
Callers pass a user ID obtained from an authenticated local session. The service
resolves its linked OAuth account, looks up the current GitHub login by numeric
ID, and verifies current repository admin or maintain authority. A browser's
login name, claimed installation, repository role, or webhook sender grants no
authority. Ordinary write and custom roles are rejected. Installation identity,
permission grants and repository identity are fetched live for every operation.

These methods are integration primitives, not public HTTP routes or an agent
tool interface. Their trusted caller owns the user's approval of the exact
output/action, product policy, branch protections and review/check gating.
Webhook receipt never supplies that approval. No automatic comments, PRs,
merges or runner launches occur; a job publishes only what its maintainer
authorized, on behalf of that maintainer's current authority. Check reads accept a page number (default 1) and return up to 100 checks
and status contexts with GitHub's totals; callers must request additional pages
before treating the result as complete or approving a merge.

The App writes job branches on the enrolled repository itself. Installing the
App there is enough; the operator provisions no service fork or fork namespace.
Contributor-fork pull requests remain readable, but the App cannot update them.

## Publication

A running job publishes its work at `POST /api/runner/publish`, authenticated
with its runner's bearer token (`src/jobs/publish.ts`). The JSON request names
the `job` and `attempt`, the commit the changes build on (`head`, or `null`
before the job's branch exists), a commit `message`, and `changes`: up to 500
files, 16 MiB in all, each `{ path, content, executable?, symlink? }` with
base64 content, or `null` content to delete. A symlink's content is its target.
Submodule changes cannot be published. An optional `pull: { title, body, draft }`
opens or updates the job's pull request, and `session` names the agent session
to resume if the publication needs a decision. Checkpoints publish work in
progress the same way, so a reassigned job continues from its branch, as does
a retry of a failed job: it starts from the head and pull request the failed
job recorded, and a branch moved since still becomes a decision. The reply
is `{ head, pull? }`, or `202 { decision, cancel }` when the job paused.

Submitted files are data. The publisher never checks them out or runs their
scripts or hooks: it writes blobs, a tree, and a commit with the Git Data API
and moves one branch. Before writing anything it checks, in order:

- The request comes from the job's current `(attempt, runner)` while it runs.
  A cancelling attempt may still publish its partial work. A reassignment
  increments the attempt, which fences out the previous runner.
- Every path is a plain work-tree path: no `.git`, `.` or `..` segment, no
  absolute path, backslash, or control character. Each workflow publishes
  only its own changes: `plan` only quest documents under `quest/` (Markdown
  other than `AGENTS.md` and `CLAUDE.md`), `bootstrap` only `flake.nix` and
  `flake.lock`, `start`, `iterate`, and `merge` their task's changes. No workflow changes
  `.github/workflows/`, because the App does not request the workflows
  permission; a merge commit may keep a pull request's own workflow changes,
  but not change the workflows of the head it updates. A refused change pauses the job with a `publication` decision
  listing each path and reason, instead of being dropped; the maintainer's
  answer resumes the agent's session.
- The job's requester still holds maintainer authority, and the repository's
  identity, visibility, installation, and enrollment are checked live, as for
  every other operation.
- The branch is where the job left it: absent before the first publication,
  then the last commit kix published. A `head` that differs gets a
  `409 { error, head }` naming the commit to continue from, so a runner whose
  previous reply was lost continues from what landed instead of failing. A
  branch changed outside the job, or one that earlier work left on the upstream,
  becomes a decision; publication never overwrites it. On a job's own upstream
  branch, the decision also offers to start over: at the maintainer's request
  (`restart: true` in place of an `answer`, after a live authority check), kix
  replaces the job with a new one at the job's revision, with a new agent
  session and no recorded pull request, and then force-resets the branch there.
  Replacing the job first means a concurrent answer or cancel refuses the
  restart before any commit is discarded. If the reset fails, the new job waits
  on the same Start over decision. An iterated pull request's head is never
  reset.

`plan`, `start`, and `bootstrap` jobs write their branch on the enrolled
upstream itself. `start` uses the quest's branch, `plan` uses `plan/<id>` or
`plan/issue-<n>`, and `bootstrap` uses `kix/devshell`, outside the quest claim
namespace. An `iterate` or `merge` job writes its pull request's actual head
only when it belongs to that same repository. A contributor-fork head pauses
with a decision reporting the blocked update; kix never opens a replacement
pull request. No job writes the repository's default branch, and no runner ever
receives a credential.

The App authors the commits as well as the pull requests: the service sets no
author or committer, so GitHub attributes and signs them as the App.
Contributor and model attribution comes from the agent's commit message and
pull request body, written to the repository's own instructions.

Interruptions are reconciled before anything is replayed. The service creates
the commit, records it as pending under the attempt fence, and then moves the
branch with a fast-forward-only update. If the outcome is lost, the next
publication finds the pending commit on the branch and adopts it; until then,
for up to two minutes, other publications of the job wait. GitHub cannot check
kix's fence, so the fence is rechecked immediately before that update: a
fenced-out attempt's write lands only if it passed the check before the
reassignment, and the fast-forward check means it can never overwrite newer
work. Delivery looks for the branch's open pull request before creating one,
and reconciles a refused creation the same way, so a retry never opens a
duplicate. Since the branch is verified to be where the job left it, its only
open pull request is the job's, even one a failed job opened without recording
it. A pull request opened since the job and then closed by the maintainer is
not replaced.

Planning pull requests are always drafts, as are those of jobs asked to stop.
Other jobs set `draft`, which defaults to `true` while decisions or unfinished
work remain; a later delivery with `draft: false` marks the pull request ready.
kix never converts a ready pull request back. Delivery and landing require an enabled
project; a paused project's running jobs can still preserve their work on their
branches. Job pull requests use same-repository branches, which upstream maintainers can
edit through their normal repository access.

A planning pull request's body ends with a decision section the service
writes from the job's answered `decision` questions, after those of each
failed job it continues as a retry, whether or not that job opened the pull
request (`src/jobs/trail.ts`): each round's
questions, every option with ✅ on each choice, and the
maintainer's own words. Permission requests and the service's `account` and
`publication` questions stay out, since they can name runners and accounts.
Prompts and answers are untrusted, so each appears only as a code span with its
line breaks and bidirectional controls removed: GitHub renders no Markdown or
HTML there and links no mention, issue, cross-repository or commit reference,
URL, or closing keyword. Every delivery renders the section again between
`<!-- kix:decisions -->` markers, after dropping any the agent wrote. Rounds
past GitHub's 65,536-character body limit are counted rather than cut.

GitHub keeps pull request status, checks, and reviews. `mergePullRequest`
merges only an exact head a maintainer explicitly chose, with the first method
the repository allows: squash, then a merge commit, then rebase. GitHub's
branch rules and refusals stand, and an agent's recommendation is never
approval. The decision inbox offers it on a pull request item only when
GitHub reports the PR's merge state as `CLEAN` or `HAS_HOOKS` and no job or
session holds the PR. The form binds the head on screen. A moved head asks for
another look, GitHub's refusal is shown in its own words, and neither is
retried.

### Merge jobs

On any other open, non-draft pull request that nothing holds, the inbox's
merge button starts a `merge` job instead. Picking it covers the job's own
fixes for conflicts, failing checks, and review findings; a head moved by
anyone else, a design change, and the merge skill's design checkpoint pause it
on a decision.

- The job holds the PR with the `quest:merge` label, under the contract
  `quest merge --help` states for local sessions: the bot adds it when the job
  is created, and refuses the pick while another `quest:*` label holds the PR.
  A `quest:merge` whose landing already ended unmerged is spent, and removed
  first. The job keeps the timeline event that added the label as its `hold`.
- The job's agent resolves conflicts by merging the base branch with Git. A
  publication may name that `merge` commit, which kix accepts only when the
  PR's upstream base branch already holds it; kix then publishes a merge
  commit whose files are the changes applied to the merged commit's.
- Landing is a publication with `land`: kix verifies the published head and
  the job's hold, then enables auto-merge bound to that head, entering the
  merge queue when the base has one, or merges it at once when GitHub would
  refuse auto-merge because nothing is left to wait for. It uses the method the
  job names, else the first the repository allows. A base that requires the
  `quest land` check queues the PR for that gate instead, as `quest merge
--land` does: squash auto-merge whose commit body pins the head. A refusal
  pauses the job on a decision, in GitHub's words.
- The label stays while the job runs or waits, and while the PR is queued or
  auto-merging. When the job ends without a landing in progress, or a
  `pull_request` webhook arrives and GitHub shows the landing ended unmerged,
  the App removes its own label. The PR is then an idle decision item again.

Labels need `issues: write` on the upstream; landing needs `contents: write`
and `pull_requests: write` there, as a direct merge does.

kix pull requests come from upstream branches, and GitHub gives workflows on
same-repository branches the repository's secrets, unlike fork pull requests.
So enrolled repositories must keep pull-request CI read-only: a read-only
default `GITHUB_TOKEN`, no write secrets at repository level, and write
credentials only in environments limited to protected branches. Agent-written
code then runs in CI before review with nothing it can write through.
`pull_request_target` and `workflow_run` jobs that check out a PR head fall
under the same rule. kix never runs pull request code in the publisher and
grants runners no GitHub credentials.

Installation grants are broader than any one publication: `contents: write`
and `pull_requests: write` cover every installed repository. Each token names
one repository ID and only the permissions that step needs. Branch writes get
`contents: write` on the upstream alone, and pull request delivery gets
`pull_requests: write` there. That token could write any unprotected upstream
branch; the service restricts it to the job's branch or the pull request's head
and refuses the default branch. Repositories should still protect their default
branch.

Mocked tests cover this path. These GitHub behaviors still need a live check
against real installations ([operator setup](../quest/m0/kix/operator-setup.md)):
plan/start/bootstrap publication on the enrolled upstream without a fork,
GitHub's signature on App-authored API commits, and pushing or resetting a job
branch under the repository's branch rules.

## Webhooks and revocation

`POST /webhooks/github` verifies `X-Hub-Signature-256` over the exact raw bytes
before parsing. GitHub's 25 MB payload ceiling bounds the request. Delivery IDs,
body digest, event and minimal installation/repository metadata persist in D1;
untrusted issue/PR bodies are not stored. Dedup and lifecycle changes commit in
one transaction. A duplicate cannot reapply a state transition; reuse with a
different body/event is rejected for 30 days; each insert prunes older records
in the same transaction. There is no asynchronous enqueue/ack gap or remote side
effect here.

Deleted or suspended installations immediately gate new local operations.
Permission and repository-selection changes invalidate the recorded revision;
operations never rely on a cached revision for authority. Created/unsuspended
installations can reopen the local gate, but every operation still queries
GitHub live, so delayed events cannot restore access GitHub revoked. A failed
GitHub lookup, removed repository, reduced permission, suspended installation,
or changed repository ID fails closed. Already in-flight remote writes may
finish; no new work is authorized from event observations. Consumers should
reconcile current provider state rather than replay issue/PR payloads as facts.

## Operator setup

1. Review the manifest's name, homepage, webhook URL, callback URL, permissions
   and events. The callback is `https://kix.quest/api/auth/callback/github`;
   **Request user authorization (OAuth) during installation** is enabled.
   Register the public App once under the service owner's account using
   [GitHub's manifest flow](https://docs.github.com/en/apps/sharing-github-apps/registering-a-github-app-from-a-manifest)
   or enter the same settings in GitHub. For the manifest flow, submit the JSON
   as the `manifest` form field to GitHub's new-App endpoint with a random
   CSRF state and your operator-controlled redirect URL. Verify returned state
   and exchange the temporary code at `POST /app-manifests/{code}/conversions`
   within one hour. This repository intentionally has no public registration
   callback that would disclose the generated credentials.
2. Store the returned/generated App ID in the `GITHUB_APP_ID` Wrangler var.
   Put the PEM private key and high-entropy webhook secret into Workers secrets
   named `GITHUB_APP_PRIVATE_KEY` and `GITHUB_WEBHOOK_SECRET` using
   `bun run wrangler secret put NAME` from `cloudflare/`. Keep multiline PEM
   intact. Set `GITHUB_CLIENT_ID` and `GITHUB_CLIENT_SECRET` to this same App's
   OAuth client ID and client secret (the manifest conversion returns
   `client_id` and `client_secret`). No separate OAuth app is used. The App ID
   and OAuth client ID are different values. Never commit conversion responses,
   PEM keys, installation tokens or `.dev.vars`.
3. Install the public App on selected upstream repositories. Existing
   installations must accept permission increases before operations needing
   those grants become available. GitHub's installation UI, not browser form
   claims, chooses repository access. Enroll each repository on `/projects`;
   jobs publish their branches there, with no fork setup.
4. Run `bun run wrangler d1 migrations apply DB --remote`, then the normal
   Worker deployment from [README](README.md). GitHub App setup, credentials,
   production deployment and live installation tests
   are operator work; this change performs none of those external actions.
5. Send a GitHub ping, check successful delivery, then test installation
   suspension/removal and repository deselection in a development installation.
   Check that service operations reject revoked access and reduced permissions.
   Use GitHub's delivery/redelivery UI to retry failed deliveries. Rotate the
   private key and webhook secret through Workers secrets and the App settings.

Sign-in starts at kix.quest and keeps Better Auth's persisted state and cookie
checks. An authorization callback started by installing the App directly on
GitHub has no sign-in state from kix.quest: its code is discarded and the
visitor returns to the sign-in form, then completes a fresh state-bound flow.
Installation and sign-in do not enroll a repository; the maintainer still opts
in on `/projects` after a live authority check.

For local tests, fixtures sign bodies and mock all GitHub API responses. No
production credentials, GitHub account or installation are required.

The earlier draft #43 informed JWT/signature handling and current repository
identity checks. Its Rust/WASM, mirroring, Artifacts credentials, custom changes,
workflow orchestration and repository coordinator design were not reused.

## Project enrollment

`/projects` is the short maintainer setup flow, separate from the quest board
and decision inbox. It resolves the registered App's installation URL, accepts
an explicit `owner/repository` selection, and verifies the linked GitHub
identity's current maintain/admin authority through the existing service.
Installing the App never creates a `github_projects` record or enables work.
Repository selection resolves its installation using the App JWT, then reads
metadata with a token restricted to the named repository and metadata-read
permission. Subsequent authorized operations scope tokens by repository ID.
Resolution uses the same installation gates and token revocation as other
reads; it never consumes GitHub's shared anonymous repository-lookup quota.

The preview reads the default branch at an exact commit, validates its Quest
tree with the shared core, and lists ready quests. Blob selection uses the
core's `isQuest` predicate, excluding root and nested `AGENTS.md`/`CLAUDE.md`
instructions just as the CLI does. It fetches all quest blobs
in one GraphQL read using the scoped installation token, rather than one
external request per file. Blob IDs come from the pinned Git tree; missing,
binary, truncated, partial, or hash-mismatched content fails closed. This keeps
enrollment's external request count independent of the number of quest files.
It rejects private,
unavailable, incomplete, invalid, and symlinked quest snapshots. Repositories
without Quest files follow `/setup`; no repository writes occur during setup.

The D1 enrollment records a project-wide enabled/paused state, distinct from
installation permissions. Every opt-in/resume, pause, and disconnect rechecks
current authority and provider gates. Pause/disconnect do not require valid
Quest files, public visibility, or an active/unarchived repository, so maintainers can stop contributions after
those conditions change. Disconnect deletes the enrollment, not the GitHub
App installation or existing contributions. Remembered selections are only
navigation and never confer authority. Any current maintainer can select an
already enrolled repository by name and reach pause/disconnect even if it has
become private, archived, or Quest-invalid. The enrolled-project lookup proves
current identity and authority independently of the failing preview; it does
not depend on being the original enroller. It matches enrollment by the durable
GitHub repository ID, and refreshes the stored owner/name after authority is
verified, so selecting a renamed repository recovers the same stop controls. If a transfer
or reinstall changes the App installation, those stop controls remain available
while the new installation requires explicit opt-in; selection never silently
reassigns an existing contribution authorization to the new installation. Future job coordination must recheck
this state and current provider eligibility before launching new work.

Contributions require a public repository whose GitHub-detected SPDX license
identifier matches a license marked `isOsiApproved: true` in SPDX's current
published license metadata. A recognized SPDX identifier alone is insufficient.
Missing, `NOASSERTION`, custom, and non-OSI licenses cannot opt in. Add or correct
the repository's license on GitHub and return to setup; no manual attestation
or review bypass is provided. This policy was selected by the maintainer on
2026-10-15 to make public open-source eligibility explicit and independently
verifiable.

Each preview, opt-in, and resume reads
`https://spdx.org/licenses/<detected SPDX ID>.json` without storing a positive
authorization cache. The returned ID must match exactly, and the approval flag
must be the boolean `true`. Failed/malformed lookups fail closed with guidance;
pause and disconnect remain available. Opt-in/resume recheck live repository
identity, visibility, detected license, OSI approval, and maintainer authority
after reading the quest snapshot. Neither license names nor browser form fields
can override those checks. Deprecated SPDX identifiers GitHub still detects
remain supported when SPDX marks that exact ID OSI-approved.

This uses the maintained [SPDX JSON interface](https://github.com/spdx/license-list-data/blob/main/accessingLicenses.md)
instead of maintaining an application allowlist. Approval freshness follows
SPDX's latest published license list and the upstream serving infrastructure.
GitHub's detector only recognizes a limited set of license files, so custom or
unrecognized arrangements stay ineligible even when they may be open-source.
See the official [GitHub license API](https://docs.github.com/en/rest/licenses/licenses),
[SPDX license list](https://spdx.org/licenses/),
[Git trees API](https://docs.github.com/en/rest/git/trees#get-a-tree),
[GraphQL blobs](https://docs.github.com/en/graphql/reference/git#blob), and
[App metadata API](https://docs.github.com/en/rest/apps/apps#get-the-authenticated-app).

The setup preview does not reserve or launch ready quests.
The jobs/funding quests own live eligibility checks and contribution execution.

## Project state and activity

An enrolled project's setup page links to `/projects/github/<owner>/<repo>/state`.
Webhooks reread observations in the background (see below), and a maintainer
can refresh them explicitly with its same-origin form. Each read rereads the default branch at an exact commit using the preview's shared
snapshot reader and validates the Quest tree with the pure core. The authenticated
board and nested quest pages use the existing `Project` seam. Source links retain
the exact commit; live project state never replaces GitHub as authority.

Each refresh advances two passes with independent opaque cursors. The history
pass reads one page of native issues and **all** PRs (including human
contributions and closed/merged PRs); continue reconciliation until it finishes.
A completed history pass detects deleted entities, and refreshing after one starts
again, so missed webhooks and later changes to old entities are recovered. The
occupancy pass reads open PRs and `quest/` branches, the only activity that
decides candidates, and starts again on every refresh after it completes. Its
pages are small, so candidates are normally current after a single refresh no
matter how long the history is. Candidates remain pending while the occupancy
pass is incomplete or a webhook has invalidated it.
This deliberately avoids GitHub's bounded, delayed activity feed; GitHub does
[not automatically redeliver failed webhooks](https://docs.github.com/en/webhooks/using-webhooks/handling-failed-webhook-deliveries).
There is no scheduled background poll in this stage.

Each webhook that names an issue or PR (a comment on a PR names the PR by its
number), or that invalidates candidates (below), asks for a background read of its enabled project once its delivery commits.
The read runs after the response (`waitUntil`) with the App's read-only,
repository-scoped installation token, and is the same read as a refresh: one
page of each pass, plus every entity a webhook named since it was last read,
fetched by number in the same GraphQL query. A new issue or PR therefore shows
its title and state after one read however far the history pass is from it,
and a closed one stops showing as open. A lease in `github_project_state` lets
one read run at a time per project: it answers every request made before it
started, requests made during it get one more read, and duplicate deliveries
never reach it, so a burst costs one or two reads rather than one each. A
per-entity webhook count lets a read clear only the updates it saw. One
invocation reads at most three rounds, to stay within a Worker's subrequest
budget; a request left after them waits for the next webhook or a refresh.
A read overtaken by another read or by a webhook's revision bump reads again.
Paused and disconnected projects are not read. A failed or rate-limited read is
recorded and shown next to the refresh fallback, and is not retried: only a
request made during it gets another round, and otherwise the next webhook or a
refresh reads again. Checks, statuses and other pushes name no entity and
change no candidate, so they cost no read.

The inbox also treats a PR whose row still says open as closed once a
complete, current occupancy pass no longer lists it, so a missed close webhook
corrects itself on the next read.

A single GraphQL activity query reads up to 50 issues, 50 PRs, 100 open PRs and
100 branch claims, keeping external request count independent of entity/file counts. Bulk
D1 writes use `json_each`, avoiding a query per entity or SQLite's parameter
limit. A revision comparison commits each page and cursor atomically; concurrent
refreshes or an intervening webhook cannot publish over a newer observation.
Only a PR opening, closing, reopening or receiving new commits, a `quest/` branch
being created or deleted, or a push to the default branch invalidates candidates
and restarts the occupancy pass; new work waits for the next read, so a job
binds the PR head and tree the maintainer saw. Checks, statuses, comments,
reviews and other pushes do not invalidate candidates, so a busy repository
neither withholds candidates nor races a refresh. Installation tokens remain read-only,
repository-scoped, and revoked after use.

Durable activity items use the GitHub repository ID, entity kind and full database
ID. GitHub's GraphQL `fullDatabaseId` strings and webhook numeric IDs map to the
same stored text key. Duplicate delivery IDs, redelivery with new IDs, later
pushes/comments/reviews, and reconciliation all update the same item. Webhooks
retain identity pointers only, never issue/PR bodies. Authoritative API reads add
escaped titles, state, comment/review counts, current PR head, that head's check
rollup, aggregate review decision, and up to 20 latest reviewer records with an
explicit pagination flag. Raw bodies and individual check logs are not cached:
a PR's body is kept only as whether it has a `## Decisions needed` section.
Unavailable/deleted entities retain their notification identity and are marked
missing rather than disappearing or presenting old state as current.

GitHub reports `mergeStateStatus` `UNKNOWN` while it computes mergeability and
may send no event once it has. A read that sees it on a recorded PR at the same
head keeps the last known merge state, so nothing looks new; at a new head it
stores `UNKNOWN` but leaves the item's change time, so it becomes news once a
definite state arrives. A newly seen PR is news either way.

Closed entities only appear in the activity log, so a read that finds an entity
closed for longer than `RETENTION` (`cloudflare/src/github/state.ts`) deletes its
row instead of updating it, unless a webhook named it again since. History
rereads every entity, so a pass prunes every expired row. The board, inbox, jobs
and `/data` read only open entities and unread webhook pointers, through a
partial index, and the activity log pages 50 rows at a time, so neither read
grows with a repository's history.

A PR associates with a quest only when its head branch exactly matches the quest's
path without `.md` (or an epic's `/README.md`). An unrelated human PR remains in
activity without a guessed association. Open associated PRs and observed quest
branch claims exclude that quest from candidate data; branch claims display as
Claimed on the board. So does a draft PR its starter still holds, one without a
`## Decisions needed` section, which the inbox lists as in progress rather than
as a decision; a ready PR or a handed-back draft is Ready to turn in.
As in the CLI, a `quest/` branch whose tip is the head of a merged PR from it
claims nothing, since its work landed; one whose PR closed unmerged, or with
commits pushed after the merge, still does. A push to an existing branch does
not invalidate candidates, so such a push shows on the next occupancy pass.
Runner/run associations belong to job coordination.

Every cached read and refresh proves current maintainer authority, live repository
identity/public visibility, installation access, and enrollment for that
installation. Refresh rechecks those boundaries after provider reads. A
background read has no user, so it checks the same boundaries except maintainer
authority; it publishes observations only, and grants or caches no authority.
Every page and action still rechecks the maintainer acting on it. Paused
projects remain readable but have no candidates. Disconnect cascades cached
snapshots and activity; explicitly enrolling a replacement installation clears
prior observations. No positive authority cache is created. Candidate data is an
observation tied to its commit, **never execution permission**: job coordination
must validate current eligibility, fresh revision, locks, and PRs before a start.
Review/check data is similarly descriptive and cannot approve a merge.

The `/data` endpoint exposes the same authenticated snapshot and open activity with
`Cache-Control: no-store` for future decision and job consumers. The activity
page is a secondary read view; the durable decision inbox and its unread/answer
state belong to the prompts workflow. Neither incoming activity nor refreshing
starts a model, creates a quest/job, spends usage, or writes to GitHub.
