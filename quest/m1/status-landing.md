# [XS] quest status reports landing and checks as they are now

## Goal

`quest status` stops printing a `landing-stopped` line once the PR has been
queued again, including through `quest merge --land`. A required check whose
newest run passed counts as passed, even if an older run of it was
cancelled.

## Plan

Decided 2026-10-31 (user, /quest-plan of the follow-ups from a moq-dev/moq
`/quest-complete` run).

- `summarize` in `src/cli/status.ts` takes the last removal, auto-merge
  disable, or ejection comment from the timeline, even if auto-merge was
  turned on again later. Drop the line when auto-merge's `enabledAt`, or a
  merge-queue entry, is newer than that event.
- Checks are classified one context at a time in `summarize` (`classifyCheck`).
  A cancelled run and a newer passing run of the same check both count, so
  the check still shows as failing. Count only the newest run of each check
  name.
