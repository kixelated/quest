# Merge through a host gate

## Goal

Picking a PR to merge starts no long-lived agent. `/quest-merge` queues it
inline only when a counted review names its head, or the head is trivial;
otherwise `/quest-iterate` runs first. A gate on the maintainer's host lands
small batches: a base PR plus up to floor(log₂ n) others that merge cleanly,
checked once on the chain's tip and pushed as one squash commit per PR. A
conflict on the base PR or a failing batch ejects the PRs and hands them to an
asynchronous Codex fixer, which makes only mechanical fixes and requeues the
healthy PRs. Bisection goes away.

Non-goals: other repositories adopting the gate (moq-dev/moq, moq-dev/moq.pro
plan their own; moq.pro needs only `allow_auto_merge` and the ruleset, since
moq-dev is on GitHub Team), and changing the review policy beyond the
mechanical-fix exemption.

## Plan

Decided 2026-10-30 (user, /quest-plan). Per-PR `/quest-merge` sub-agents were
wasteful: each one stayed alive to fix conflicts and failures that the gate
can hand off instead.

- Goal, as stated above:
  - ✅ Yes, as stated
  - Also include moq adoption
  - Narrower: only the skill changes
- Where the gate runs. Keeping it in GitHub Actions was recommended, since it
  is live and isolates the push credential; the user chose the host.
  - Keep GitHub Actions
  - ✅ Move to this host
- Architecture, once on the host:
  - Host orchestrates, CI on Actions
  - ✅ Everything on this host: the worker runs the check locally through
    `quest gate`, pushes, and starts Codex. No Actions involved in landing.
  - Everything stays in Actions
- Queue signal. The user asked for a check nobody reports, so PRs stay in
  auto-merge until the host reaches them; `main`'s ruleset already requires
  the unreported `quest land` check. GitHub keeps auto-merge across a
  writer's push, so the gate compares the head to the pin and ejects
  `head_moved`.
  - ✅ Pinned auto-merge (`quest merge --land`) plus `quest:merge`
  - Label only, with the label's time against the last push
- Retry cap for the fixer:
  - 2 attempts
  - ✅ 1 attempt
  - The review-round checkpoint
- Push credential:
  - Your gh auth through the admin bypass, check sandboxed
  - ✅ A moq-bot App key on this host, check sandboxed
  - Your gh auth, no sandbox
- Runtime. A one-pass systemd timer was recommended:
  - systemd timer, one pass per run
  - ✅ A long-running daemon
- Review of the fixer's changes:
  - Claude reviews them through `quest review`
  - ✅ None: Codex makes only mechanical fixes; anything that would need a
    review is ejected and handed back
- Mechanical fixes:
  - ✅ No behavior change, recorded in `## Review`
  - Tool-verifiable only
- Batch:
  - ✅ The longest-queued PR as the base, plus the next PRs in queue order
    that merge cleanly onto the chain, up to floor(log₂ n)
  - Quest priority order
- Open PRs: land
  [moq-dev/quest#289](https://github.com/moq-dev/quest/pull/289) now, as it
  fixes live wrong ejections until the host gate replaces that code; close
  [moq-dev/quest#277](https://github.com/moq-dev/quest/pull/277), since an
  ejection now removes `quest:merge` and the fixer adds it back.
- Security (user, 2026-10-30): the gate runs as a dedicated user under a
  hardened unit. PR code and Codex run in ephemeral nspawn containers with no
  credentials. moq-bot tokens are minted per push and scoped to this
  repository. Codex reaches its model through the host's CLIProxyAPI, so the
  Codex login stays outside the container. A maintainer's approval of the
  pinned head covers evaluating its devShell, but the fixer may not touch
  files that run outside the sandbox.
- No GitHub Actions in landing (user, 2026-10-30): the daemon replaces the
  Land workflow and the host's `quest-land` Actions runner, and ejection
  comments carry the failing log's tail.
- This epic ranks first in m0. It replaces the hook-started kix fixer that
  [moq-dev/quest#276](https://github.com/moq-dev/quest/pull/276) proposes
  (`kix/eject-fix`).
- The epic finishes with an end-to-end run on moq-dev/quest: a batch with one
  PR that fails a check, one that conflicts with the base, and one healthy
  PR. The healthy PR lands after the requeue, the mechanical one lands after
  its fix, and the other is handed back. `CONTRIBUTING.md` and the README's
  landing section describe the host gate.

## Required

- [Host daemon](/quest/m0/host-land/daemon.md) - `quest land serve` lands batches and ejects without bisecting
- [Gate host](/quest/m0/host-land/host.md) - kixelated/nixos runs the daemon as its own user, checks in nspawn containers, and retires the Actions runner
- [Codex fixer](/quest/m0/host-land/fixer.md) - ejected batches get one mechanical fix attempt and healthy PRs are requeued
