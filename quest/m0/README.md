# moq-dev adoption

## Goal

moq-dev plans and runs its own work through Quest and kix:
moq-dev/moq, moq-dev/quest, and moq-dev/moq.pro are enrolled at
`https://quest.moq.dev`, maintainers answer decisions from a phone-friendly
web app with push notifications, and their own Linux and macOS runners do
the work through Claude Code and opencode inside each project's Nix
devShell. The GitHub App bot publishes ordinary PRs. The standalone CLI
(v0.1.0 shipped on 2026-10-07) keeps serving the same repositories locally on
macOS, Linux, and native Windows.

Work that only third-party repositories need, and the public launch, belong
to [m1](/quest/m1/README.md).

## Plan

Decided 2026-10-30 (user, /quest-plan), replacing "First public release":

- Should m0 serve moq-dev's repositories before third parties?
  - ✅ Yes: m0 is adoption on moq-dev/moq, moq-dev/quest, and moq-dev/moq.pro;
    a new m1 holds the public release, and the old m1 became m2
  - Fold third-party work into the existing later milestone

  No resources go into a public service before it works for moq-dev.
- Where does the Worker live until the public launch?
  - ✅ quest.moq.dev
  - kix.moq.dev

  [Open kix.quest](/quest/m1/open.md) moves it for the launch.
- Which kix work leaves m0? ✅ Onboarding (pick repositories, setup PR,
  guide), ✅ the public face (theme, landing page, launch material), ✅
  contributor sandboxing (untrusted-head VM, stock-Ubuntu AppArmor, macOS
  verification), and ✅ the enrollment-time read-only CI check. Head approval
  and opencode sandboxing stay, since moq-dev's own jobs need them.
- moq-dev/moq comes first, then private repositories so moq.pro can enroll.

Decided while planning the first release (2026-09-26), replacing the earlier
copied-files and ownership-manifest design:

Decided while planning m0 (2026-09-26), replacing the earlier copied-files and
ownership-manifest design:

- The binary carries the skills, the quest contract, and all hook logic.
  `quest init` installs only static stubs into a repository: one-line skill
  stubs, one reference line in its root instructions, one `.gitattributes`
  line, and Claude hook entries in `.claude/settings.json` that only call a
  `quest` subcommand. Upgrading never rewrites repository files. (Amended
  2026-10-26 (user), replacing "Nothing is vendored", so `quest init` can
  install the agent lifecycle hooks.)
- The repository's own tool manager pins the version: mise (release binaries)
  or a nix flake input (any rev, built from source). Quest ships no launcher
  and no pin file; an install outside either is simply unpinned.
- The CLI may call GitHub (amended 2026-10-07, replacing "offline except
  `quest run`" after agents' hand-rolled polling tripped GitHub's rate
  limits). Prefer offline, deterministic commands, and keep GitHub calls in
  the CLI rather than skill prose.
- Repository-specific rules stay in the repository's own root instructions.

## Required

- [Kix decision UI](/quest/m0/kix/README.md) - planning and implementation through prompts and summaries, run on the maintainer's own runners
- [Codex cloud off](/quest/m0/codex-cloud-off.md) - automatic Codex cloud reviews stop once no open PR relies on them
- [Review reports an expired login](/quest/m0/review-login.md) - `quest review` says to log in again instead of failing with a 401
- [Live sandbox test](/quest/m0/review-sandbox.md) - the real reviewer CLIs run nothing a reviewed head plants
- [Agent test environment](/quest/m0/agent-test-env.md) - `just test` passes inside agent sessions
- [Stale skill stubs](/quest/m0/init-prune.md) - `quest init` and `quest uninstall` remove stubs of retired skills such as `quest-ready`
- [Bun EFAULT report](/quest/m0/bun-efault.md) - condition: Bun fixes concurrent `rmSync` on Windows; report it, then drop the workaround
- [Codex project-config skip](/quest/m0/codex-project-config.md) - condition: Codex keeps a supported way to skip a project's `.codex/` layer; then reviews keep the user's config
- [Gate bench](/quest/m0/gate-bench.md) - measure headroom admission on an idle host
- [Gate admission on CI](/quest/m0/gate-ci-admission.md) - gated commands admit on loaded hosted runners like arm64 macOS
- [Agent lifecycle integration](/quest/m0/worktree-agents.md) - reclaim completed and suspended Claude checkouts through its hooks
- [Agent workflow helpers](/quest/m0/helpers/README.md) - CLI commands for CI waits, PR status, claims, quest moves, and serialized merges
- [Review harness check](/quest/m0/review-harness.md) - recurring each milestone: newest pinned review models, and the live sandbox test passes
