# [XS] quest land merges locally instead of trusting GitHub's mergeability

## Goal

`quest land` never ejects a PR as `merge_conflict` because of GitHub's
mergeability alone. When the squash API refuses a PR that GitHub marks as
conflicting, the gate merges the base into it locally with the quest merge
driver, pushes that merge, and lands the PR. It ejects only when the local
merge also conflicts.

## Plan

Decided 2026-10-31 (user, /quest-plan of the follow-ups from a moq-dev/moq
`/quest-complete` run). GitHub reported conflicts on
[moq-dev/moq#7407](https://github.com/moq-dev/moq/pull/7407), which merges
cleanly, and on [moq-dev/moq#7382](https://github.com/moq-dev/moq/pull/7382),
whose only conflict was in quest link lists, which the driver resolves.

`mergePinned` (`src/cli/land-serve.ts`) returns `merge_conflict` when
`pull.mergeable === false` or `mergeable_state === "dirty"`. Hand that case
to `prepareHead` (`src/cli/land-head.ts`), which already merges with the
driver through `mergeBase` (`src/cli/land.ts`), instead of ejecting.
